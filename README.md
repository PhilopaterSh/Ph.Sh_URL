# Ph.Sh_URL - Reconnaissance and URL Collection Tool

`Ph.Sh_URL` is an open-source intelligence (OSINT) tool written in Go, designed to collect and discover URLs associated with a specific domain by searching multiple data sources concurrently.

##  Features

- **Multiple Sources**: Gathers data from 4 different sources to ensure broad coverage.
- **High Performance**: Utilizes Go's Goroutines technology to execute searches in parallel, providing superior speed.
- **Flexible Input/Output**: Supports reading domains from a file or standard input (stdin), and allows specifying the output file.
- **Flexible Key Management**: Relies on a `config.yaml` file for API key management.
- **Automatic Setup**: The tool automatically creates its configuration file when needed.
- **Silent Mode**: The `-silent` option prints only URLs, ideal for scripting. When not in silent mode, logging output is concise, without timestamps, with simplified source-specific messages, and includes a domain counter (e.g., `Processing domain 5/100: example.com`).
- **Clean Results**: Deduplicates found URLs and saves them to a single text file. Also, performs enhanced validation and cleaning of input domains, skipping invalid ones with a warning.

## ðŸŽ¨ Colored Output

`Ph.Sh_URL` now uses colored output to make the logs more readable. The colors are used to indicate the status of the different operations:

- **Green**: Success messages.
- **Red**: Error messages.
- **Yellow**: Warning messages.
- **Blue**: Informational messages.

Here is an example of the new output:

```
[INFO] Loaded 3 domains.
[INFO] Processing domain 1/3 (33.33%): google.com
[OTX] Found 50000 URLs
[VT] Found 0 URLs
[Wayback] Found 3 URLs
[HudsonRock] Found 0 URLs
[INFO] Waiting for 20s before next domain. Estimated time remaining: 40s
[INFO] Processing domain 2/3 (66.67%): example.com
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Progress and Timer

To enhance user experience, `Ph.Sh_URL` now includes:

-   **Progress Percentage**: Displays the completion percentage as it processes domains.
-   **Estimated Time Remaining**: Shows an estimated time until all domains are processed.

Example of the new progress indication:
```
[INFO] Processing domain 1/3 (33.33%): google.com
...
[INFO] Waiting for 20s before next domain. Estimated time remaining: 40s
[INFO] Processing domain 2/3 (66.67%): example.com
...
```

## ðŸš¦ Graceful Shutdown

`Ph.Sh_URL` supports graceful shutdown. If you interrupt the process (e.g., by pressing `Ctrl+C`), the tool will automatically save all the URLs found up to that point to the output file before exiting. This ensures that you don't lose any data even if you stop the scan midway.

##  Data Sources

The tool relies on the following sources:

1.  **VirusTotal**: Requires an API key.
2.  **AlienVault OTX**: Works without a key, but using one is preferred for better results.
3.  **The Wayback Machine**: Works without a key.
4.  **Hudson Rock**: Requires an API key for full data. If no API key is provided, the tool will attempt to fetch data but will filter out common redacted/encrypted URL patterns.

##  Setup and Usage

### 1. First-time Setup

When running the tool for the first time, it will look for a configuration file. If not found, it will automatically create one in the following path:
- **On Linux:** `~/.config/Ph.Sh_URL/config.yaml`
- **On Windows:** `C:\Users\YourUser\.config\Ph.Sh_URL\config.yaml`

The tool will then stop and ask you to edit this file. Open the file and add your API keys in the designated sections.

```yaml
# Configuration file for Ph.Sh_URL
virustotal:
  - "YOUR_VT_API_KEY_1"

alienvault:
  - "YOUR_OTX_API_KEY_1"

hudsonrock:
  - "YOUR_HUDSONROCK_API_KEY_1"
```

### 2. Installation

To install the tool, ensure you have Go installed (version 1.16 or higher). Then, run the following command:

```bash
go install github.com/PhilopaterSh/Ph.Sh_url@latest
```

This command will compile the source code and place the executable (`Ph.Sh_url` or `Ph.Sh_url.exe` on Windows) in your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

To make it globally accessible on Linux systems (like Kali Linux), you might want to move it to a common bin directory:

```bash
sudo mv "$(go env GOPATH)/bin/Ph.Sh_url" /usr/local/bin/
```

This ensures you can run `Ph.Sh_url` from any directory.

### 3. How to Use

You can use the tool in several ways:

**a) Via a file:**
```bash
Ph.Sh_url -d domains.txt -o found_urls.txt
```

**b) Via Standard Input (stdin):**
```bash
cat domains.txt | Ph.Sh_url -o all_urls.txt
```

**c) Silent Mode (to display results only):**
```bash
cat domains.txt | Ph.Sh_url -silent | tee urls.txt
```

**Usage Options:**
- `-d`: Path to the domains file (optional if using stdin).
- `-o`: Path to the output file (default: `endpoints.txt`).
- `-silent`: To enable silent mode.
- `-e`: Comma-separated list of sources to exclude (e.g., `vt,hr`). Available sources: `vt` (VirusTotal), `otx` (AlienVault OTX), `wayback` (The Wayback Machine), `hr` (Hudson Rock).

## ðŸ“‹ Results

The tool saves the list of unique URLs in the file you specify via the `-o` option, or in `endpoints.txt` by default.

## ðŸ”„ Updating the Tool

To update `Ph.Sh_url` to the latest version, simply run the `go install` command again:

```bash
go install github.com/PhilopaterSh/Ph.Sh_url@latest
```

This will download and compile the newest version, replacing your old executable.

To check the currently installed version, use the `-version` flag:

```bash
Ph.Sh_url -version
```
